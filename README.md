# Copy Extractor

A small Next.js app (deployable to Vercel) that scrapes a web page — typically a
Shopify page — and pulls out only the **core visible copy**: no navigation, no
pop-ups/modals/cart drawers, no footer. The copy is grouped into a heading tree
(`h1 → h2 → h3 → h4 → h5`) that you can expand/collapse, plus a raw-markdown panel
you can copy or download.

## What it extracts

- **Headings** `h1`–`h5` — used to build the nested, collapsible groups.
- **Paragraphs** `p`, **links** `a` (with `href`), **buttons** `button` / `[role=button]`,
  **list items** `li`, **quotes** `blockquote`.
- **Everything else** with visible text falls under **`content`** (leaf text in
  `div`/`span` containers, common on page-builder landing pages).
- **Buy-box** — copy inside a product purchase region (variant/size/quantity
  selectors, add-to-cart, subscription/pack options) is kept but tagged as
  **`buybox`** so it's easy to tell apart from marketing copy. It shows an amber
  `BUY-BOX` badge in the tree and a `` `[buy-box]` `` prefix in the raw markdown.

Inline formatting inside a block is preserved as markdown: `**bold**`, `*italic*`,
`[text](href)`, `` `code` ``.

## How the filtering works

1. **Anchor** to the primary content container — `main` / `[role=main]` /
   `#MainContent` / `article` — which already excludes the site header, nav and footer.
2. **Strip chrome** that can still live inside `main`: `nav`/`header`/`footer`,
   dialogs, drawers, carts, modals, pop-ups, cookie/consent banners, newsletter
   prompts, `[aria-hidden]`/`[hidden]` nodes, `script`/`style`/`svg`, and elements
   whose `class`/`id` match high-confidence chrome keywords.
3. **Walk** the remaining DOM in document order, emitting one block per meaningful
   element.
4. **Dedupe** duplicate blocks that come from responsive mobile/desktop variants
   (themes render both copies into the DOM).
5. **Group** the flat blocks into the heading tree.

The extraction logic lives in [`lib/extract.ts`](lib/extract.ts) and is framework-agnostic.

## UI features

- **Show levels** toggle chips (`H1`–`H5` for the levels present, plus **Content**).
  Defaults to **H1 + H2 on, Content off**, so you start with a clean heading outline;
  turning off an intermediate level hoists deeper selected headings up to keep the tree intact.
- **Content** groups every non-heading item (paragraphs, links, buttons, quotes, buy-box)
  behind one toggle — off by default so the outline isn't cluttered.
- On load, **H1 and H2 start expanded**; deeper levels start collapsed.
- **Expand all** / **Collapse all**.
- Per-item type badges (`P`, `A`, `BTN`, `LI`, `QUOTE`, `CONTENT`, `BUY-BOX`) and level tags (`H1`…`H5`).
- **Copy markdown** to clipboard and **Download .md**.
- A **Raw markdown** textarea for pasting into other tools.
- **Grade narrative flow** (optional) — see below.

## Narrative flow grade

An optional button that scores how easy the page's **heading outline (H1–H4)** is to
follow, and draws a visual of the reading path with arrows between headers.

The grade is a **deterministic, explainable heuristic** — not an AI/semantic judgment
— computed in [`lib/narrative.ts`](lib/narrative.ts) from the heading structure:

- **Skipped levels** (e.g. H1 → H3) — the biggest readability hit; each one is
  highlighted with an amber arrow in the flow so you can *see* where the story jumps.
- **Number of H1s** — one clear top-level topic scores best.
- **Section count** — too many top-level sections is hard to hold in mind.
- **Heading length** — long headings are harder to scan.
- **Starting level** — outlines that open below H1 start mid-hierarchy.

It produces a 0–100 score, a band (*Easy to follow → Hard to follow*), a plain-English
list of what helped or hurt, and the arrow flow diagram (color-coded by level). Because
it only reads structure, it's labelled as a *structure grade* in the UI — it does not
claim to judge the writing itself.

## Writing grade (AI, optional)

A second optional button, **"✦ Grade the writing (AI)"**, judges whether the *story
itself* makes sense — the thing the structural grade can't do. It sends the extracted
copy to Claude ([`app/api/grade-writing/route.ts`](app/api/grade-writing/route.ts)) with
a strict rubric and returns an **evidence-cited** critique:

- A 0–100 coherence score + band + one-line verdict.
- Per-dimension scores for **logical flow, message clarity, consistency, gaps /
  non-sequiturs, redundancy**, each with a short assessment and a phrase **quoted
  verbatim from the copy**.
- **Narrative-framework detection** — identifies which of your configured frameworks
  (AIDA, PAS, StoryBrand, …) the copy most closely follows and scores how completely it
  moves through that framework's stages, with quoted evidence (or "None").
- Actionable **strengths** and **issues**.

### Narrative frameworks (editable config)

The frameworks the grader matches against are a config "learning file" —
[`lib/frameworks.ts`](lib/frameworks.ts) ships 7 popular ones (AIDA, PAS, Before–After–Bridge,
StoryBrand SB7, The 4 Ps, FAB, PASTOR). Edit them in-app via the **hamburger menu →
Settings → Narrative frameworks**: add, edit, or remove frameworks (name, stages,
description). Changes persist in `localStorage` (per browser) and are sent with each
writing grade, so the AI grades against *your* frameworks.

It's kept grounded (judge only the provided text, quote real phrases, allow "unclear")
and uses structured outputs so the response is always valid. It's clearly labelled as an
AI reading of the copy — distinct from the deterministic structure grade.

**Requires an API key.** Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local` (local) or in your
Vercel project's Environment Variables. Without it, the button returns a friendly message
telling you to set the key. Model: `claude-opus-4-8`; cost is a few cents per grade.

```bash
# .env.local
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

Then paste a URL (or click the built-in example) and hit **Extract copy**.

## Deploy to Vercel

The app is a standard Next.js App Router project — no extra config needed.

```bash
# Option A: Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel
vercel            # first run links/creates the project
vercel --prod

# Option B: push to a Git repo and "Import Project" at vercel.com
```

The scrape runs in a Node.js serverless function (`app/api/scrape/route.ts`,
`runtime = "nodejs"`, `maxDuration = 30`).

## Notes & limitations

- Extraction uses server-side `fetch` + [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) on the
  page's **initial HTML**. Content rendered purely client-side (after JS execution)
  won't be captured — most notably **third-party review widgets** (Okendo, Yotpo,
  Rivo, etc.), which hydrate after load. Most Shopify pages server-render their core
  copy, so this is rarely an issue for marketing/landing/funnel pages. To capture
  JS-injected content you'd swap the `fetch` for a headless browser (e.g. Playwright
  + `@sparticuz/chromium` on Vercel).
- Tested against three different Shopify setups: a landing page (firstday.com), a
  funnel page (try.javvycoffee.com), and a product page (trueclassictees.com).
- Requests to internal/local addresses are blocked, and fetches time out after 20s.
- Product-form copy that lives inside `main` (e.g. "Quantity", "Delivery Frequency")
  is treated as real content and kept, since it is genuinely visible on the page.
